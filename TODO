*** Features that will make this thing function better and be nicer to hack on

** DATABASE/models changes
* Re-work Pick model so that it better maps to scoring criteria
  (makes form generation less like ju-jitsu)
* Add sub-score info to make score breakdown view possible.
  (doesn't need to be stored in db, just need to break out
   scoring categories into sub-functions)
* Add score history so we can plot scores as function of time


** views
* Re-write view_picks to have a nicely formatted table of group ranks and
  a bracket-style knock-out stage (c.f. Wikipedia's HTML bracket impl.)
* Show time of last score update
* Show breakdown of score of pick on results detail view.
* Show breakdown of score of pick on results overview.
* Re-write base.html to be prettier (nav-bar at top or side; add some color
  to text and bg, add the mascot image in the upper right)
* Add a message board view.  (Probably can just borrow this from somewhere.
  Could even be a live chat as that would make the games more fun)
* Modify make pick and view picks to be based on a tournament starting
  time (i.e. can make picks and view own picks up until kick-off of first
  game; aftwerwards, can't make new picks but can view other players picks).
* Allow users to identify active picks and/or delete unwanted picks.
* Add a view that explains the scoring
* Re-write the make_pick view to ensure consistent picks and reduce choices
  as picks are made (multiple views or javascript?)
* Add view to show scores as function of time
* Stats page (most picked scorers and defensive teams, correctly picked upsets,
  best picks for scorers and defensive teams)
