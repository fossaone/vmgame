*** Features that will make this thing function better and be nicer to hack on

** DATABASE/models changes
* Add regularized player/team names to database
  (unidecode.unidecode(player_name).lower())
  (this will save head-aches with inconsistent naming when we pull in data)
* Re-work Pick model so that it better maps to scoring criteria

** Results update
* Fix player/team score updates to match based on regularized names.
  (This will require a bit of a hack until/unless we add the regularized names
  to the database.)
* Add knock-out stage to the updater/scraper.

** views
* Re-write view_picks to have a nicely formatted table of group ranks and
  a bracket-style knock-out stage (c.f. Wikipedia's HTML bracket impl.)
* Show breakdown of score of pick on results detail view.
* Show breakdown of score of pick on results overview.
* Add a message board view.  (Probably can just borrow this from somewhere.
  Could even be a live chat as that would make the games more fun)
* Modify make pick and view picks to be based on a tournament starting
  time (i.e. can make picks and view own picks up until kick-off of first
  game; aftwerwards, can't make new picks but can view other players picks).
* Allow users to identify active picks and/or delete unwanted picks.
* Re-write base.html to be prettier (nav-bar at top or side; add some color
  to text and bg, add the mascot image in the upper right)
* Add a view that explains the scoring
* Re-write the make_pick view to ensure consistent picks and reduce choices
  as picks are made (multiple views or javascript?)
