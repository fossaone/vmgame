*** Features that will make this thing function better and be nicer to hack on

** DATABASE/models changes
* Re-work Pick model so that it better maps to scoring criteria
  (makes form generation less like ju-jitsu)
* Add score history so we can plot scores as function of time
* Switch from SQLite to MySQL to speed up calls


** views
* Re-write view_picks to have a nicely formatted table of group ranks and
  a bracket-style knock-out stage (c.f. Wikipedia's HTML bracket impl.)
* Add rank to results page table, acount for identical scores.
* Add user's country to results page table.
* On user picks page, in Group results could bold two teams that advance to show they got that right.
* Add a message board view.  (Probably can just borrow this from somewhere.
  Could even be a live chat as that would make the games more fun)
* Allow users to identify active picks and/or delete unwanted picks.
* Re-write the make_pick view to ensure consistent picks and reduce choices
  as picks are made (multiple views or javascript?)
* Add view to show scores as function of time
* Stats page (most picked scorers and defensive teams, correctly picked upsets,
  best picks for scorers and defensive teams)
* Scenario generator/runner (how many points can each person get if they get all the remaining    	matches correct.) 
* Allow filtering on results page, could filter based on specific picks or based on possible points   	given teams still in the running.
* Use bootstrap for registration pabe and login page.
* Make sure when someone registers they are logedin and don't need to login afterwards.
* Allow people to start typing in striker names and have it autocomplete with possible choices.

** Update/scraper
* Fix third place and champion to account for possible ties.  (May just be easier to set these 		 	manually).
